# VLDB-2007-Aggregation
Source code for [*Adaptive Aggregation on Chip Multiprocessors*](http://www.vldb.org/conf/2007/papers/research/p339-cieslewicz.pdf) published at VLDB 2007 by [John Cieslewicz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PDwcE7wAAAAJ) and [Kenneth A. Ross](http://cs.columbia.edu/~kar).

## Disclaimer
 * This code was written to run on a SUN [UltraSPARC T1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UltraSPARC_T1).
 * I no longer have access to a T1 and have no idea if this still compiles.
 * To the best of my knowledge and based on timestamps of the original files, I believe this to be the final version of the code, but given that it has been over a decade I cannot be 100% sure.
